# Statistics-Basics
In this repository I've kept a statistics assignment which has helped me to brush up my basic statistical formulae.

I've used a sensor datasset to analyze the outliers of the data as well as has performed some 
basic statistical formulas like:
1. Minimum value
2. Maximum Value
3. S.D.
4. Varience
5. Mean
6. Correlation
7. Median
8. M.A.D.
